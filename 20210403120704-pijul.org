*** Even if the industry all of a sudden believed [[file:20210403120704-pijul.org][pijul]] was superior to [[file:20210325213010-git.org][git]], I'm sure [[file:20210403121225-github.org][Github]] wouldn't just take the L and switch to pijul.

**** [[file:20210403121429-is_pijul_better_than_git.org][Is pijul better than git]]? 

* Why isn't pijul more popular?

** Is it because it's a patch based [[file:20210403120639-version_control_system.org][version control system]]?
