* Could pijul ever supplant [[file:20210325213010-git.org][git]]?

** wouldn't this be tantamount to supplanting [[file:20210403121225-github.org][Github]] the company?

*** [[file:20210403121246-why_is_git_so_popular.org][Why is git so popular]]? 

*** Even if the industry all of a sudden believed [[file:20210403120704-pijul.org][pijul]] was superior to [[file:20210325213010-git.org][git]], I'm sure [[file:20210403121225-github.org][Github]] wouldn't just take the L and switch to pijul.

**** [[file:20210403121429-is_pijul_better_than_git.org][Is pijul better than git]]? 

** I think it would require having some sort of integration with [[file:20210325213010-git.org][git]]

C'mon pijul you can do it... Beat git! Actually to gain mind share I think offering something that lets one use both git and pijul concurrently would be necessary.

Imagine saying "git cherry pick" is annoying, let's use "pijul git cherry pick" that doesn't have this ordering restriction. No idea if this is feasible, maybe @pijul_org
 can say ;)

* Why isn't pijul more popular?

** Is it because it's a patch based [[file:20210403120639-version_control_system.org][version control system]]?

** Is it because, allegedly, the maintainer has issues with open source?

<maerwald> pijul is unpopular, because the maintainer has had
		      issues with open source ;)  [12:31]
