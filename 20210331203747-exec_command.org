#+title: exec command

My uses [[file:20210330214302-in_practice.org][in practice]] have basically been "I'm using this shell script to setup an environment and only really want the executable I'm exec'ing to run after".

*** oh wow, this is a good example

#+begin_example
Let’s run an experiment to understand it better:

$ pstree -p
init(1)─┬─init(52)───bash(53)
        ├─init(78)───bash(79)───pstree(108)
        └─{init}(7)
$ echo $$
79
$ exec sleep 300

We checked the PID of the current shell using echo $$ and pstree commands and then executed a sleep of 300 seconds using exec. Let’s now switch to a different terminal to check the process list:

$ ps -aef | grep $USER
user1       53    52  0 23:37 tty2     00:00:00 -bash
user1       79    78  0 23:39 tty1     00:00:00 sleep 300
user1      111    53  0 23:40 tty2     00:00:00 ps -aef
user1      112    53  0 23:40 tty2     00:00:00 grep --color=auto 

As we can see, PID 79, which was initially assigned to Bash, is now assigned to the sleep command.

We’ll also observe that after 300-second sleep finishes, the session (terminal), which had PID 79, exited since the shell was replaced by exec command, and its execution has completed.
