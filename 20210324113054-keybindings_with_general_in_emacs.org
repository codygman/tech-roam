#+title: keybindings with general in emacs

* Under evil

** Questions
*** Is this the correct way to use =my-leader-def= throughout =:general= sections in use-package?
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package evil
    :general
    (my-leader-def
      :keymaps 'override
      :non-normal-prefix "s"
      ;; TODO this one doesn't belong here really
      "l" 'evil-window-right
      )
    )
#+end_src

** correctly overriding keybindings that other use-package modes add

I'm not sure how to do this... I thought it was "just use the override keymap" but apparently not.

Currently my "S-l" binding I bind in my config like:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq exwm-input-global-keys
        `( ;; ... snip
          ([?\s-l ] . evil-window-right)
           ;; ... snip)
#+end_src

Actually I guess that wouldn't be enough, I should also do:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package evil
    :after general
    :init
    (setq evil-want-keybinding nil
          evil-want-integration t)

    :general
    (my-leader-def
      :keymaps 'override
      :non-normal-prefix "s"
      ;; TODO this one doesn't belong here really
      "l" 'evil-window-right
      )
#+end_src

*NOTE*: untested
