* Overriding third party functions in your emacs config

** I once had success (dumb luck) with simply redefinining the fnction in my config 

** that doesn't seem to work for my newest case

** So it seems elisp advice might be the way to go

** Yep, looks like this will work

(advice-add 'name-of-func-to-override :override
            (lambda () (message "does this instead now")))
#+end_src
