#+title: figure out how to tangle org files faster

* Try worgle (c program)

I'm stuck because I don't know [[file:20210404231915-how_to_compile_c_programs_with_dependencies_in_nixos.org][how to compile c programs with dependencies in nixos]]... ahh one way is just to install =nameoflib.dev= like =slqlite.dev=.

This didn't seem to do anything for my config sadly and there wasn't even error output :/
