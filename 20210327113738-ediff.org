#+title: ediff

* ediff has always worked well for me, but recently I get an error:

#+begin_example
ediff-prepare-error-list: Errors in diff output.  Diff output is in #<buffer *ediff-diff*>
#+end_example

* For the trivial files a and b

** a 
#+begin_example
test
#+end_example

** b
#+begin_example
#+end_example

* I get this output

** ediff-errors

* I found a variable called [[help:ediff-diff-ok-lines-regexp]]

** its value is 

"^\\([0-9,]+[acd][0-9,]+?$\\|[<>] \\|---\\|.*Warning *:\\|.*No +newline\\|.*missing +newline\\|^?$\\)"

* guesses

** Is it a [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/9246184][localization issue]] even though I'm not using a different language?
