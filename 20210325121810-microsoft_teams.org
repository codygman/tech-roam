#+title: microsoft teams

Gives me lots of trouble in [[file:20210323182419-exwm.org][exwm]] because it steals focus :S

Also I'm not sure if it's the fault of [[file:20210325122031-sound_issues_in_linux.org][sound issues in linux]] or Microsoft treating Linux as a second-class platform but I have various issues from time to time:

- Teams switches my output for reasons
- Teams switches my input for reasons
- Both my input/output are correct, but I cannot hear anything
- Both my input/output are correct, but no one can hear me

The two former are fixed by restarting teams, but beware... by default teams just goes to the tray so you'll have to really kill it to fix the issue.

If only teams would support [[file:20210325122258-xmpp.org][XMPP]] it would at least solve the window manager issues I encounter and mean I only need teams for calls/video calls.
