#+title: Github notifications in emacs

[[https://github.com/magit/forge][forge]] is awesome, but it's not really scalable if you have a lot of github notifications. I wonder if maybe github notifications are redundant because [[file:20210325205245-rss.org][RSS]] serves the same purpose.

* Does github provide an [[file:20210325205245-rss.org][RSS]] feed for their notifications?

I don't see any official support, but I see a random repo:

https://github.com/webmastak/rss-feed-notifications

It looks like zapier provides something too:

https://zapier.com/apps/github/integrations/rss/10417/post-new-github-notifications-to-an-rss-feed

Anywho... back to the immediate topic.

* incremental github notifications with gh-notify

Status: Blocked by [[file:20210325213600-github_issue_gh_notify_github_api_error.org][github issue: ghnotify github api error]]

The package provides incremental updates to forge's github notifications so I should give it a try.
