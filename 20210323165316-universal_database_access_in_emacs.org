#+title: universal database access in emacs

* Databases I've had a reason to access in the past

This is the bare-minimum, since I'll likely need to access one I haven't used before in the future:

- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB
- SQLite
- Cassandra
- MySQL
- Redis
- Oracle
- Microsoft SQL Server


* Candidates

** TODO see what lsp-mode's sql lsp server integration provides (it might be easiest)

*** [[file:20210329094954-universal_database_access_with_org_babel_and_lsp_mode.org][universal database access with org babel and lsp-mode]]

[[file:20210329110637-some_new_page.org][some new page]]

** [[file:20210323165335-ejc_sql.org][ejc-sql]] (can access all [[*Databases I've had a reason to access in the past][required DBs]])
*** pros
**** Access database the jvm can
*** cons
**** complicated setup, especially [[file:20210323165044-using_ejc_sql_on_nixos.org][using ejc-sql on NixOS]]


** [[file:20210323165404-emacs_edbi.org][emacs-edbi]] (can access many [[*Databases I've had a reason to access in the past][required DBs]], notably excluding mongo)

*** pros
**** not sure yet

*** cons

**** Perl seems to be a dieing language

***** at the very least, it's mongo dbi interface was deprecated because no one was using it


** [[file:20210323165857-sql_mode.org][sql-mode]] (can access many [[*Databases I've had a reason to access in the past][required DBs]], notably excluding mongo)

** Access via org mode integrations

*** PostgreSQL via [[file:20210323165857-sql_mode.org][sql-mode]]


*** MongoDB via [[https://github.com/krisajenkins/ob-mongo][ob-mongo]]


*** SQLite via [[file:20210323165857-sql_mode.org][sql-mode]]


*** TODO Cassandra?


*** MySQL via [[file:20210323165857-sql_mode.org][sql-mode]]


*** TODO Redis?


*** Oracle via [[file:20210323165857-sql_mode.org][sql-mode]]


*** Microsoft SQL Server via [[file:20210323165857-sql_mode.org][sql-mode]]


* Methods

** Database Clients like [[file:20210323165335-ejc_sql.org][ejc-sql]] or emacs-edbi

*** pro: visual representation of tables

** Via org mode

*** pro: Queries in (what can be) lightweight org source blocks

*** con: No autocompletion unless you get [[file:20210323165335-ejc_sql.org][ejc-sql]] working
