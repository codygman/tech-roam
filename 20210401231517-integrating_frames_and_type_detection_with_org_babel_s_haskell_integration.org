#+title: integrating frames and type detection with org babel's haskell integration

Man this would be cool.

Basically look at how frames autodetects types in a csv:

https://acowley.github.io/Frames/

Now look at the examples in [[file:20210401224605-literate_programming_in_org_mode_with_haskell.org][literate programming in org-mode with haskell]], namely [[file:20210401224605-literate_programming_in_org_mode_with_haskell.org::*there it is, we made lists from shell blocks work with haskell blocks][there it is, we made lists from shell blocks work with haskell blocks]]

Know that they are all strin... wait no they're not:

#+begin_src haskell
Prelude> "org-babel-haskell-eoe"
Prelude> let list = ((1, "some-text"), (2, "some-text"), (3, "some-text"))
print list
"org-babel-haskell-eoe"
#+end_src

Anywho... there are string like things that frames could infer the type of... I think. Maybe I'm misremembering ;)

We'll see one day.
