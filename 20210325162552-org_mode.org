#+title: org-mode

It's built on [[file:20210322214027-emacs.org][emacs]] and I use it for programming, [[file:20210330222449-personal_information_management.org][personal information management]], [[file:20210330222622-literate_programming.org][literate programming]], [[file:20210325121403-literate_debugging.org][literate debugging]] and more (I'll add that later).

This all made possible by [[file:20210404231009-literate_configuration_in_org_mode.org][literate configuration in org-mode]]


random gripe: It'd be nice if something put spacing between org mode notes at the font/layout level rather than hacks to preserve newlines that don't always work.
