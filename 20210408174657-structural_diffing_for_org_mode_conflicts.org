#+title: structural diffing for org mode conflicts

I need this to more easily resolve diffs that arise because I can't figure out [[file:20210408181912-how_to_make_syncthing_sync_faster.org][how to make syncthing sync faster]].

* Oh wow, I think this is my entire project idea maybe

https://github.com/jessstringham/org-mode-diff

I'm trying to build this and staring the page [[file:20210408181742-building_python_applications_with_nix.org][building python applications with nix]] with it as an example
 
* The basic idea is a conflict usually happens for me for two reasons

** they both follow this pattern
*** I did something to my org files with orzly on my phone

*** I did something on my laptop before the modified org file(s) synced

** The common things changed in order of occurence are

*** existence

**** ex: I created a new heading on phone, then on pc before previous synced to pc

**** ex: I deleted a new heading on phone, then on pc before previous synced to pc

*** change one or more heading titles

*** changed order

* These aren't structural diffing, but interesting nonetheless
