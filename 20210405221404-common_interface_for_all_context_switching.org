#+title: common interface for all context switching

A [[file:20210322221637-narrowing_framework.org][narrowing framework]] preferably that uses what I find to be an intuitive orderless fuzzy find.

The same interface for switching editor buffers and applications.

The idea is that the cognitive overhead will be amoritized and the precise variant will become quicker.

Right now I use buffer switching primarily, but I'm wondering about an alt-tab equivalent in emacs since I either:

1) don't find buffer switching quick enough
2) the order of buffers don't make sense to me

If 2, note that your selectrum/consult/prescient settings could affect the stability of this.
