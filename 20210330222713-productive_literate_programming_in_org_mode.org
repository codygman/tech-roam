#+title: productive literate programming in org-mode

* When you first see literate programming in org-mode it's cool

You think... cool! Then you try it and get annoyed at the overhead of having to type not only your code, but also:

#+begin_src org
  ,#+begin_src haskell
  -- your code here
  ,#+end_src
#+end_src


* You get annoyed with overhead, but learn about snippets

** builtin

*** You reduce the overhead using =<s= or defining your own =<hs=

At least, you did in pre-emacs 27... but if you're on 27 or newer you'll need to enable org-tempo:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
 (when (version<= "9.2" (org-version))
    (require 'org-tempo))
#+end_src

** yasnippet

*** then maybe you find out about yasnippet and install it 

*** maybe you go so far as to customize company-mode to tab complete snippets (I haven't yet)


* You use yasnippet with tab-complete and never wish for anything else, DONE

* Well.. not really... there are still things that could be nicer in practice

* Things I argue are more important than snippets

** Observation: most of what I do is [[file:20210325121403-literate_debugging.org][literate debugging]]  

*** that consists of

**** see if something is true or false

**** do something

**** see if something is true or false

*** this means: Most [[file:20210325121403-literate_debugging.org][literate debugging]] is executing the last code snippet

*** For code snippets that don't change, perhaps you should have named your code snippet (or better; had it given an automatic name for you to reference)

*** For code snippets that are almost the same but a little different, it'd be nice to have [[file:20210330223845-org_mode_babel_source_block_history.org][org-mode babel source block history]]
