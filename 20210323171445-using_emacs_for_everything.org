#+title: using emacs for everything

Of course... not everything. You wouldn't want to try and replace photoshop with Emacs (as far as I know :D ).

Here are some things I do want to pull into the unified, extensible, and heavily documented emacs ecosystem:

- [[file:20210323172451-git_in_emacs.org][git in emacs]] (DONE: Magit!)
- [[file:20210323165316-universal_database_access_in_emacs.org][universal database access in emacs]]
- [[file:20210323171657-universal_chat_in_emacs.org][universal chat in emacs]]
- [[file:20210323172614-password_management_in_emacs.org][password management in emacs]]
- [[file:20210323172848-screenshots_in_emacs.org][screenshots in emacs]]
- [[file:20210323173247-clipboard_management_in_emacs.org][clipboard management in emacs]]
- [[file:20210323175034-life_management_in_org_mode.org][life management in org-mode]]
- [[file:20210323181941-consuming_content_in_emacs_with_rss.org][Consuming content in emacs with RSS]]

I have many other things I want to do in emacs
