#+title: teachability of programming languages

Some languages have reputations as easy to learn, like [[file:20210325162650-python.org][Python]].

Others have reputations as hard to learn like [[file:20210323175936-haskell.org][Hoaskell]].

How much of that is to due with familiarity of paradigm(s)?

How much is due to one or the other being objectively harder or simpler?
