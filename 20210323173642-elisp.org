** conditionally add item to list

I just had an issue where I want to conditionally add org-agenda-files to =org-refile-targets=, but only if it doesn't already exist.

I don't immediatley know how to do that

Doesn't assq do something like that? I was thinking of assoc. I did this:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref org-agenda-config :tangle no
  (unless
      (seq-some (lambda (x) (eq (car x) 'org-agenda-files)) org-refile-targets)
    (add-to-list 'org-refile-targets '(org-agenda-files :maxlevel . 5)))
#+end_src
