#+title: password management in emacs

I actually currently use Bitwarden for this because it has an independent security audit. Since I'm using consult and selectrum, I'd ideally have a consult based interface that works with bitwarden.

My most common case will be copying passwords for a given record into the kill ring, but I'm sure that looking at secure notes will also be useful.
