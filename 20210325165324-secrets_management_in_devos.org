You can take a look at my setup at: gitlab.com/coffeetablebrothers/myrddin. I use agenix and it was really easy to integrate with devos. Just added it as a flake input, and added the module in extern and the package to devShell. I dropped git-crypt, tbh the most annoying part you have to remove the git filter and move the directory, push and move the directory back and push. Then you just follow the directions in the agenix repo. Its agenix -e to edit secrets within secrets folder, then just add different secrets to your profiles with the agenix module.
