#+title: daily issues using codygman/devos

Performance issues could be found easily with the pie-in-the-sky [[file:20210326112259-monitoring_exwm_with_prometheus.org][monitoring exwm with prometheus]]

* My window manager froze because of org-roam/with-editor/automatically kill gpg buffers making an expensive find call
*** time 1: Uhh... things just froze what?
#+begin_example
Debugger entered--entering a function:
  , * substitute-command-keys("Quit")
  call-process-shell-command("/run/current-system/sw/bin/find -L \"/home/cody\" -t..." nil t)

*** time 2: my automatic tab creation called on git commit :S
Automatic tab creation on startup is also run when =with-editor= is called (aka when I do a git commit :S)

This also causes =org-roam-directory= to be set globally to =.= meaning anytime I enter my home directory an expensive find command runs on my entire home directory looking for =*.org.gpg= :S

*** ~NOTE~ I think this only happens on merge commits

* After rebuilding with [[file:20210324202244-devos.org][DevOS]] sometimes networking gets messed up in docker

All of my calls to the internet inside of it fail
