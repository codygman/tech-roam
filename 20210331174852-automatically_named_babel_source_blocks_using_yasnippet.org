#+title: automatically named babel source blocks using yasnippet

* Oh my gosh this was easy, lol. Now I guess I have automatically named blocks

#+begin_example
# key: sql
# name: sql
# --
#+name: `(string-trim (shell-command-to-string "uuidgen"))`
#+begin_src sql
$1
#+end_src
$0
#+end_example

* TODO todo prepend source block type in front of name

* TODO research shorter formats than uuid that are reasonably unique ([[file:20210331191851-shorter_alternatives_to_uuids.org][shorter alternatives to uuids]])
