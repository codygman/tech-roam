Had issue [2021-03-23 Tue 18:26]

most recent: https://github.com/codygman/devos/commit/2bb415d952d6ce8a1e2889ef982f699e6e6a69b5

suspect:

https://github.com/codygman/devos/commit/fdf025796d6861f00380da4ad5b1a5946d87c411
https://github.com/codygman/devos/commit/8679918d9da5d9913de7fea89c647d344623cf2f

earliest I think caused it:

https://github.com/codygman/devos/commit/eedf122338f560822b39d0104eb067f461518ba6

* If I spend too long in an [[https://github.com/agzam/exwm-edit][exwm-edit]] buffer the "connection" is lost between that text input box and exwm-edit

It might be related to https://github.com/agzam/exwm-edit/issues/5#issue-349768256

https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm/issues/465

Possible workaround:

I might actually just have an older version of exwm-edit, lol
