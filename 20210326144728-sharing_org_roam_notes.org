#+title: sharing org-roam notes

[[file:20210326144748-org_roam.org][org-roam]] is amazing, but usually you'll want to share thoughts from your second-brain with others.

One easy way of doing that is using Github and simply uploading your [[file:20210325162552-org_mode.org][org-mode]] files to take advantage of their automatic org-mode preview.

That has some downsides:

- Hierarchy is not nearly as apparent
- complicating the above, not many different fonts are used so emphasis isn't as obvious

Another way to share them is to generate html and end up with something like:

https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes

This is powered by (I think) the same as in this blog:

https://commonplace.doubleloop.net/20200821142536-how_i_publish_my_wiki_with_org_publish

It's not showing atm... but a cool feature of the above was [[https://commonplace.doubleloop.net/the-map]["The map"]] which presented a graph where you could click results. However there was an even cooler animated version [[https://hugocisneros.com/notes/][here]].
