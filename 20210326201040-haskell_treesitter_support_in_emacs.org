#+title: haskell treesitter support in emacs

It'd be nice to have [[file:20210326201227-treesitter.org][treesitter]]/[[file:20210326201235-treesitter_haskell.org][treesitter-haskell]] support in [[file:20210322214027-emacs.org][emacs]]


Here's a thread on doing it with neovim, maybe that could give a head-start:
